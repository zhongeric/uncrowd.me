This was a fun project I started during quarantine The goal was to parse Google's popular times feature for stores and restaurants in order to help users make informed decisions before going out.

I spent a *lot* of time figuring out how to decode Google Map's map URL encoding to fetch their popular times data, and even cycled through proxies (IP adddresses) to avoid rate limiting.

We never launched it fully as another opportunity came up, but this repo contains the full backend for the project. We did have a lot of fun playing with the Humaaans design lib with its new addition of masks.

I also did the front end for this here: https://github.com/zhongeric/uncrowd.me-site.
